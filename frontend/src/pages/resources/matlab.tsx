            Hey friends, the slaves at MathSoc have created an Interactive MATLAB guide, 
            which can be accessed here. It is meant to supplement the MATH1151/MATH1251 
            online modules, and contains 4 fun little projects to sink your teeth into. 
            Note that it builds on, and does not replace, those modules which are excellent 
            and comprehensive resources in itself.
            <br />
            <br />
            To access it, please export all given files into the same folder and double 
            click on the one that says â€˜open thisâ€™.
            You: I want to learn a programming language.
            <br />
            <br />
            Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions, suggestions 
            or spot any mistakes! ðŸ™‚
